# SIRModels

Compartmental modeling has been a subject of interest since the early 1900s. Among the ﬁrst to mathematically model the spread of epidemics in the early twentieth century were William Hamer and Ronald Ross. They achieved this by using the law of mass action by which they explained the epidemic behavior of disease. In the study of epidemiology, compartmental models are used to predict how infectious diseases spread throughout a population.

# The Compartmentl Models
To simplify such a model, the members of a population are compartmentalized into various diﬀerent groups–in the case of SIR, the groups are susceptible, infected and removed/recovered.

# Variations
Although the SIR model is the most studied, there are other models which are variations of the SIR, including but not limited to the SIS, MSIR and SEIR models. There are beneﬁts of the SIR model for many; pharmaceutical companies are impacted by SIR and other related models for they approximate the amount of people who will become infected, allowing the companies to make a proﬁt when selling the antibiotics and also down the road producing and proﬁting oﬀ of a vaccination, along with insurance companies.

# Practicalities
The models allow the companies to see how much they would have to pay out to families, from medical bills to life insurance policies. Giving the insurance companies a good idea of what they should make their premiums and who they should insure. In summation, using compartmental models to simulate epidemics is just as useful for saving lives as it is for making a proﬁt.
